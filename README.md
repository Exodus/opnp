#Python Numpy Pandas (PNP)

Numpy and Pandas take a while to build. This container aims to have numpy and pandas installed globally on a reliable python version.

Currently supporting:

Python 3.10
Pandas: latest
Numpy: latest

Todo:
- Add a matrix build for different versions of Python
- Matrix for the different versions of numpy pandas (maybe)
- Support different base images (add ubuntu)
